abstract: Accurately predicting the bucket ﬁll rate of excavators is a challenging
  task due to factors such as material ﬂowability and the complex coupling interactions
  between the material and the bucket. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
  a bucket ﬁll rate prediction method based on multi-sensor data fusion and deep learning.
  The ITCBAM model was developed by integrating a Convolutional Block Attention Module
  (CBAM) into the InceptionTime framework, leveraging multi-source sensor data such
  as cylinder displacement and stereo vision to enable precise predictions of ﬁll
  rates. Results show that the ITCBAM model achieves prediction errors of 9.48% and
  10.65% on the familiar and unfamiliar test sets, respectively. Compared to physical
  models and other deep learning models, it demonstrates higher prediction accuracy
  and stronger generalization capability. This method facilitates excavation decision-making,
  enhances construction efﬁciency, and provides valuable insights for further research
  on the automation and real-time prediction of construction machinery.
