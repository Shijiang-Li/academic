abstract: Accurately assessing the difficulty of material excavation is crucial for
  reducing excavator energy consumption, ensuring operational safety, and optimizing
  excavator efficiency. Addressing the challenges of uncertain and difficult-to-judge
  excavation conditions for underground materials, this paper proposes a Bayesian
  deep learningbased method that integrates excavation process data to identify excavation
  difficulty. Firstly, we constructed a deep learning model based on Bayesian theory
  and decomposed the uncertainty of the identification results into aleatory uncertainty
  and epistemic uncertainty. Next, through a mechanistic analysis of the interaction
  between materials and the excavator bucket during excavation, we identified the
  input features for the model. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the method
  through experiments. The results show that the proposed method not only accurately
  identifies the excavation difficulty of the material but also quantifies and decomposes
  the uncertainty of the identification results, demonstrating both theoretical significance
  and practical application value.
