 abstract = {Accurately assessing the difficulty of material excavation is crucial for reducing excavator energy consumption, ensuring operational safety, and optimizing excavator efficiency. Addressing the challenges of uncertain and difficult-to-judge excavation conditions for underground materials, this paper proposes a Bayesian deep learningbased method that integrates excavation process data to identify excavation difficulty. Firstly, we constructed a deep learning model based on Bayesian theory and decomposed the uncertainty of the identification results into aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Next, through a mechanistic analysis of the interaction between materials and the excavator bucket during excavation, we identified the input features for the model. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the method through experiments. The results show that the proposed method not only accurately identifies the excavation difficulty of the material but also quantifies and decomposes the uncertainty of the identification results, demonstrating both theoretical significance and practical application value.},
