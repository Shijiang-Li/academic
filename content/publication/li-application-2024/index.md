abstract: 'Accurate measurement of the working resistance encountered during excavation
  plays a vital role in improving production efficiency, reducing energy consumption,
  and enabling intelligent capabilities in excavators. To address the challenges of
  the inaccurate measurement of working resistance, we present a novel method for
  measuring excavator working resistance based on physics-informed machine learning
  (PIML). Firstly, we construct a mechanism model, which incorporates the kinematic
  and dynamic models of the excavator working device. Next, by integrating the mechanism
  models with machine learning algorithms, a soft sensing model for excavator working
  resistance based on the PIML method is developed. Finally, experimental analysis
  is conducted to compare the predictive performance of three different methods: mechanism
  modeling, data-driven modeling, and PIML. The results indicate that the PIML method
  allows for a more precise estimation of the working resistance experienced during
  the excavation process of excavators, and it holds significant theoretical and practical
  implications.'
