abstract: Operating data-driven inverse design (DID) provides updated knowledge for
  the forward design process. It forms a closed-loop of design enhancements in which
  uncertainties from different sources, such as the model and environment, have a
  significant impact on the design and optimisation results. This paper proposes a
  method for analysing DID uncertainty based on Bayesâ€™ theorem. First, the sources
  of uncertainty in the forward and inverse design processes are analysed, and the
  a priori information is defined in the inverse design process. The inverse relationship
  prediction model is based on correlation information and the a posteriori information.
  A clustering method is proposed to extract information on different working conditions
  from the operating data to provide a basis for masspersonalised design. Then, the
  a posteriori information and working conditions information are fed back to the
  forward design process for design optimisation, forming a closed-loop interaction
  process of forward and inverse design. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness
  of the above methods are illustrated with a case study on the inverse optimisation
  of the structural characteristic parameters of a bicycle, and the clustering identification
  of environmental working condition load parameters for mass personalisation.
