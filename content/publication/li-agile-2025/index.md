abstract: The ability to rapidly and accurately identify high-value requirements and
  complete the conceptual design and performance validation of iterative products
  is crucial for companies to achieve swift product upgrades and enhance market competitiveness.
  This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest methods and practices reported
  in the literature, covering various aspects such as requirement mining, scheme generation,
  and scheme validation in conceptual design. Furthermore, it proposes a framework
  for agile conceptual design and validation based on multi-source product data and
  Large Language Models (LLMs). The specific research focus areas include requirement
  mining using product usage data, AI-based conceptual scheme generation, and rapid
  conceptual scheme validation facilitated by physics-informed data-driven approaches.
  Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and future research prospects of agile
  conceptual design based on multi-source product data and Large Language Models.
