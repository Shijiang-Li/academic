	abstract = {Accurate measurement of the working resistance encountered during excavation plays a vital role in improving production efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and enabling intelligent capabilities in excavators. To address the challenges of the inaccurate measurement of working resistance, we present a novel method for measuring excavator working resistance based on physics-informed machine learning (PIML). Firstly, we construct a mechanism model, which incorporates the kinematic and dynamic models of the excavator working device. Next, by integrating the mechanism models with machine learning algorithms, a soft sensing model for excavator working resistance based on the PIML method is developed. Finally, experimental analysis is conducted to compare the predictive performance of three different methods: mechanism modeling, data-driven modeling, and PIML. The results indicate that the PIML method allows for a more precise estimation of the working resistance experienced during the excavation process of excavators, and it holds significant theoretical and practical implications.},

Addressing the challenges of uncertain and difficult-to-judge excavation conditions for underground materials, this paper proposes a Bayesian deep learningbased method that integrates excavation process data to identify excavation difficulty. Firstly, we constructed a deep learning model based on Bayesian theory and decomposed the uncertainty of the identification results into aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Next, through a mechanistic analysis of the interaction between materials and the excavator bucket during excavation, we identified the input features for the model. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the method through experiments. The results show that the proposed method not only accurately identifies the excavation difficulty of the material but also quantifies and decomposes the uncertainty of the identification results, demonstrating both theoretical significance and practical application value.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the bucket ﬁll rate of excavators is a challenging task due to factors such as material ﬂowability and the complex coupling interactions between the material and the bucket. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a bucket ﬁll rate prediction method based on multi-sensor data fusion and deep learning. The ITCBAM model was developed by integrating a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the InceptionTime framework, leveraging multi-source sensor data such as cylinder displacement and stereo vision to enable precise predictions of ﬁll rates. Results show that the ITCBAM model achieves prediction errors of 9.48\% and 10.65\% on the familiar and unfamiliar test sets, respectively. Compared to physical models and other deep learning models, it demonstrates higher prediction accuracy and stronger generalization capability. This method facilitates excavation decision-making, enhances construction efﬁciency, and provides valuable insights for further research on the automation and real-time prediction of construction machinery.},

	abstract = {Operating data-driven inverse design (DID) provides updated knowledge for the forward design process. It forms a closed-loop of design enhancements in which uncertainties from different sources, such as the model and environment, have a significant impact on the design and optimisation results. This paper proposes a method for analysing DID uncertainty based on Bayes’ theorem. First, the sources of uncertainty in the forward and inverse design processes are analysed, and the a priori information is defined in the inverse design process. The inverse relationship prediction model is based on correlation information and the a posteriori information. A clustering method is proposed to extract information on different working conditions from the operating data to provide a basis for masspersonalised design. Then, the a posteriori information and working conditions information are fed back to the forward design process for design optimisation, forming a closed-loop interaction process of forward and inverse design. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the above methods are illustrated with a case study on the inverse optimisation of the structural characteristic parameters of a bicycle, and the clustering identification of environmental working condition load parameters for mass personalisation.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate measurement of the volume of earthmoving materials is of great significance for the real-time evaluation of loader operation efficiency and the realization of autonomous operation. Existing methods for volume measurement, such as total station-based methods, cannot measure the volume in real time, while the bucket-based method also has the disadvantage of poor universality. In this study, a fast estimation method for a loader’s shovel load volume by 3D reconstruction of material piles is proposed. First, a dense stereo matching method (QORB–MAPM) was proposed by integrating the improved quadtree ORB algorithm (QORB) and the maximum a posteriori probability model (MAPM), which achieves fast matching of feature points and dense 3D reconstruction of material piles. Second, the 3D point cloud model of the material piles before and after shoveling was registered and segmented to obtain the 3D point cloud model of the shoveling area, and the Alpha-shape algorithm of Delaunay triangulation was used to estimate the volume of the 3D point cloud model. Finally, a shovel loading volume measurement experiment was conducted under loose-soil working conditions. The results show that the shovel loading volume estimation method (QORB–MAPM VE) proposed in this study has higher estimation accuracy and less calculation time in volume estimation and bucket fill factor estimation, and it has significant theoretical research and engineering application value.},
